# API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp

###    User stories:
1. User submits a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When user submits something, the file name and size in bytes is received within the JSON response

### Usage :
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:
* To handle the file uploading you should use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.
